## Getting Started

**Netrix** acts as a central monitor that can control all the replicas. This requires the developer to change the implementation being tested. See [instrumentation]({% link docs/instrumentation.md %}) to understand the changes that are required. **Netrix** can be used for:

1. [Unit testing]({% link docs/tests/tests.md %})
2. [Exploration testing]({% link docs/exploration_testing/index.md %})
3. [Visualization]({% link docs/visualization.md %})
